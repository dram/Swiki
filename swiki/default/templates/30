<h2>Help Guide to the AdminTool</h2><p>Welcome to the Swiki AdminTool! It will allow you to administrate your Swikis with a web interface. For questions on the AdminTool, check the question/answer section below. For further information, visit the <a href="http://minnow.cc.gatech.edu/swiki">Swiki Swiki</a> and/or e-mail the <a href="mailto:pws@cc.gatech.edu">PWS mailing list</a>.</p><ul><li><a href="#getStarted">How do I get started?</a><li><a href="#createNew">How do I create new Swikis?</a><li><a href="#stopRobots">How do I stop search engines from searching the site?</a><li><a href="#security">How do I set up a password protected Swiki?</a><li><a href="#shouldExternal">Should I set up an external web server to serve files and uploads?</a><li><a href="#setupExternal">How do I set up an external web server to serve files and uploads?</a></ul><hr size=1 noshade><h3><a name="getStarted">How do I get started?</a></h3><p>The first thing to realize is that this is a web server. Probably, anyone in the world can reach it, even those who might be looking to do harm. Fortunately, the only real insecurity in the system is the AdminTool. So, your first step should be to change the administrator's (ie. your) password. To do this, click on the <em>top</em> button and then on the <em>security</em> button. This will take you to the security settings for the AdminTool. From there, change the admin:password to something more secure. Remember that user:password pair, because you will be asked for it after pressing <em>update security</em>.</p><p>Next, you will want to change the settings for the swikis on the site, so that they are agreeable to your situation. To do this, click on <em>refs</em> in the left-panel Swiki listing and then on the <em>settings</em> button. This will give you a form to change the settings that most every Swiki you create will use. Probably, you should change these few settings:</p><ol><li><em>colorScheme</em> applies a certain look to the Swikis by changing the icons and the colorscheme. Pick out a <a href="/schemes/">color scheme</a> you like for this value.<li><em>adminID</em> should be changed to something more secure than admin:password.<li><em>alertSender</em> and <em>alertServer</em> should be changed to reflect your e-mail and a mail server that works from your location.<li><em>urlPrefix</em> should be changed to reflect the URL of your server (with port). You will need this if you want to use Squeak projects on your Swiki.</ol><p>Press <em>update settings</em> to store these settings.</p><h3><a name="createNew">How do I create new Swikis?</a></h3><p>To create a Swiki, click on the <em>create</em> button. From there, fill in the appropriate fields:</p><ol><li><em>Name</em> specifies the name of the new Swiki. You cannot have two Swikis of the same name.<li><em>Parent</em> specifies the behavior for the new Swiki. The new Swiki will inherit functionality and settings from its parent. Check out <a href="/refs/12">/refs/12</a> to get a feel for what the different packages provide.<li><em>Uploads</em> specifies whether uploaded files are served through this server (i.e. Comanche) or through an external web server on a different port. Probably, there will not be a choice here, considering that the later option is only given to you once you have set up an external web server. Check below to find out <a href="#shouldExternal">whether to set up an external server</a> and <a href="#setupExternal">how to do it</a>.<li>The <em>BookStorage</em> and <em>PageStorage</em> specifies how the new Swiki information is stored. Probably, your only choice will be XmlSwikiStorage, so you will not have to worry about this.</ol><p>After hitting the <em>create new Swiki</em> button, the Swiki will be created and your browser will show the setup for the site. You will probably not want to change anything here. Click on the <em>settings</em>  button to edit the settings for the new Swiki. To change a setting, you will have to select the appropriate <em>override</em> checkbox and then change the setting's value. Here are some settings you might want to consider changing:</p><ol><li><em>description</em> should give the user a better idea of what the Swiki is about. This will show up in the <a href="/">default listing</a>.<li><em>adminID</em> might be changed if you are not going to be the administrator for this Swiki. It allows for people who know the password to unlock or edit locked pages. Primarily, this is used when a page was locked accidentally or the person who locked the page forgot the password. Also, if they know the username, it gives them the power to render the site into a flat web site.<li>Also, <em>alertSender</em> should probably be the e-mail address of the administrator for this Swiki.</ol><p>To check out the new Swiki, click on the <em>go there</em> button.</p><h3><a name="stopRobots">How do I stop search engines from searching the site?</a></h3><p>Often, when a site is released to the public, search engines will find it. This can cause serious problems in accessibility and up-time, since search engines (or robots) tend to keep accessing the site continuously. Most search engines realize that this could be a problem, so they check the <a href="/robots.txt">/robots.txt</a> file before they proceed. Swiki uses this as a way to block these robots. To disallow robots, click on the <em>top</em> button and then the <em>settings</em> button. This will take you to the settings for the site. Check false on the <em>allowRobots</em> field and click <em>update settings</em>.</p><h3><a name="security">How do I set up a password protected Swiki?</a></h3><p>Most Swiki packages (such as <a href="/docs">docs</a> and <a href="/refs">refs</a>) offer a way to protect the site, so that users must enter a valid user:password pair before having access to parts or all of the Swiki. Any Swiki who's parent is one of these inherits this functionality, but not that specific security profile. To set up a security profile for a Swiki, click on the Swiki name in the left-panel Swiki listing and then on the <em>security</em> button. This will take you to security settings for that Swiki. Probably, there will be no security profile. Click on <em>create security profile</em> to create a new security profile. At the top of the form, you will notice the <em>default privileges</em>; this specifies the privileges a user has without specifying user:password. It ranges from <em>Deny All</em> (always be asked for user:password) to <em>Allow All</em> (never be asked). Selecting <em>Allow All</em> is identical to not having a security profile. The text boxes below the default privileges allow you to specify users for the available privileges. The privileges are arranged from the least amount of access (Read Only) to the most amount of access (Allow All) from top to bottom. You can specify one user per line. This can be done in two ways:</p><ol><li>You can specify a <em>user:password</em> pair. Thus, anyone logging in with this user:password will be given those privileges.<li>You can specify ip_number/ip_mask. This allows you to specify a group of IP numbers as having those privileges. For instance, 127.0.0.0 would allow the computer assigned that IP number to have those privileges. Also, 127.0.0.0/255.255.255.0 would allow the computers assigned IP numbers in the range of 127.0.0.0 through 127.0.0.255 to have those privileges.</ol><p>After filling in the fields, press <em>update security</em> to submit the security changes. Clicking on <em>delete security</em> will remove the security profile and allow anyone to access the Swiki.</p><h3><a name="shouldExternal">Should I set up an external web server to serve files and uploads?</a></h3><p>Comanche Swiki is implemented in <a href="http://squeak.org/">Squeak</a>, an open-source Smalltalk derivative with a liberal license and a portable implementation; this means it will work almost identically on most platforms (Windows, Macintosh, Linux, Unix, etc.). One of the negatives of this is that Squeak is fairly slow compared to native code. In one test, Comanche performed at one third the throughput of <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> for simple file serving; this is actually quite good performance, but there is some room for improvement.</p><p>One way to take advantage of this native-code throughput improvement is to set up a native-code web server running on the same machine on a different port number (two web servers cannot share the same port number). Then, set it up so that files (buttons, icons, styles, decorations, etc.) and uploaded files (files uploaded by users) are served through this web server. Note that uploaded files served through an external web server are not protected by the Swiki security features. Thus, even if you have an external web server set up, you will be asked whether you want to serve the uploads for that Swiki through Comanche or through the external web server, when creating a new Swiki. If this needs to be a restricted Swiki, you should serve uploads through Comanche.</p><p>Setting up an external web server is fairly easy with some technical knowledge. Plus, there is probably a free high-quality web server available for your platform. The external web server will lighten the load on Comanche and perhaps increase stability; although in some cases, the external web server has proven to be less stable than Comanche. On the other hand, Comanche should easily be able to handle light to moderate load.</p><h3><a name="setupExternal">How do I set up an external web server to serve files and uploads?</a></h3><p>These are the several steps to setting up an external web server for Comanche to use:</p><ol><li>Install the external web server on your system. For most platforms, a free high-quality web server is available. For the Windows platform, Microsoft's Personal Web Server is often included with the system and is free to download. For Unix (Solaris, Tru64, etc.) or Unix-like (Linux, FreeBSD, etc.) systems, <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> is a free and high quality solution. For the Macintosh platform, Apple's Personal Web Sharing is often included with the system and is free to download.<li>The second step is to set up the external web server to serve on a different port. This will depend on the specific web server. Usually, a web server runs on port 80. So, for instance, <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">http://www.yahoo.com/</a> is a request to http://www.yahoo.com/ on port 80. You could also do <a href="http://www.yahoo.com:80/">http://www.yahoo.com:80/</a> and get the same result. You will probably want to run Comanche on port 80, so that it can be accessed by <em>http://mywebaddress/</em> without specifying a port. Since two web servers cannot share the same port, you need to install the external web server on a different port.<li>Copy the <em>files</em> directory (found in the <em>swiki/default</em> directory) to the serving directory for the external web server.<li>Create an <em>uploads</em> directory next to the files directory.<li>Start the external web server. For convenience, you may want to make both the external server and Comanche part of the machine's start-up script.<li>Change the site settings of ComancheSwiki to reflect the new external web server. Click on the <em>top</em> button and then on the <em>settings</em> button. From there, change these settings:<ul><li><em>filePath</em> should be the directory path of the copied files directory. On a Macintosh, this might look like <em>Macintosh HD:Apple PWS:files</em>. On Windows, this might look like <em>c:\Program&nbsp;Files\Personal&nbsp;Web&nbsp;Server\files</em>. On Unix-like system, it might look like <em>/home/coweb/apache/htdocs/files</em>. Notice that in all cases, you should not have a path delimiter (: / \) at the end of the path.<li><em>fileServerPath</em> should be the URL corresponding to the files directory. Probably, it will be of the form <em>http://mywebaddress:8080/files/</em>, where 8080 corresponds to the port being used by the other web server. Notice that in this case, you do need a <em>/</em> at the end of the path.<li><em>uploadPath</em> should be the directory path of the new uploads directory. Thus, it should be the same as the <em>filePath</em>, but replace <em>files</em> with <em>uploads</em>.<li><em>uploadServerPath</em> should be the URL corresponding to the new uploads directory. Probably, it will be of the form <em>http://mywebaddress:8080/uploads/</em>.</ul>After filling in these fields, press <em>update settings</em> to submit the settings changes. You should immediately notice if something went wrong since the icons for the page will not show up. In that case, change the <em>filePath</em> value to <em>files</em> and the <em>fileServerPath</em> value to <em>/</em> to revert to the old behavior.</ol>
