<p>AniAniWeb has its own simple editing rules. To link to a page, surround the page's title by '<b>*</b>'s (i.e. '*My Page*'); if the page does not already exist, a <b>create</b> button appears next to the new title; click on it to create the new page. The extensive list below documents all the editing features; these features are meant to enhance your use, but you do not need them to get started.</p><ul><li>Carriage returns are preserved.<li>A line starting with '<b>!</b>'s becomes a header line. The more '<b>!</b>'s, the more important the header is. For example, '!!subject' will show up as '&lt;h2&gt;subject&lt;/h2&gt;' in HTML. Up to three '<b>!</b>'s can be used.<li>A line starting with '<b>_</b>' (an underscore) becomes a horizontal line. This is often used to separate topics.<li>Using lines starting with '<b>#</b>'s and '<b>-</b>'s, creates a list.<ul><li>A block of lines, where each line starts with '<b>-</b>' is transformed into a bulleted list, where each line is an entry.<li>A block of lines, where each line starts with '<b>#</b>' is transformed into an ordered list, where each line is an entry.<li>Lists can be nested. Thus, a line starting with '#-' is an element of a bulleted list that is part of an ordered list.</ul><li>To create a table, start off the lines with '<b>|</b>' and separate the elements with '<b>|</b>'s. Each new line represents a new row of the table.<li>To create a preformatted section, begin each line with '<b>=</b>'. A preformatted section uses equally spaced text so that spacing is preserved.<li>To add an append (<b>add to the page</b>) area, begin a line with <tt>+</tt>. This will turn into a text area in the view mode, so users can add to the page without editing. This can be used to stop people from deleting a page's content; simply add the <tt>+</tt> line and lock the page; now, users are able to add, but not delete. Here are several options you can use with append areas (just add the character of each feature you want after the initial <tt>+</tt>):<br><table border=0 cellspacing=3 cellpadding=0><tr><td valign=top><tt>^</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Append area stays at the top and appends go down.</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><tt>_</tt></td><td>(underscore) Appends are separated by horizontal lines. This can be useful for being able to tell the difference between different appends.</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><tt>+</tt></td><td>Append areas are self replicating, so that an append also creates another append area. In this way, it is easy to respond to a specific append.</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><tt>@</tt></td><td>Appends are marked with a timestamp. This can make it easier to identify the dynamics of certain discussions.</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><tt>-</tt></td><td>(dash) Append areas do not show up on the page. Rather, there is just a button (<b>add to the page here</b>) that takes you to a separate page to add the comment. This is particularly useful in combination with self replicating appends (<tt>+</tt> above), so that the amount of append areas does not dominate the page's content.</td></tr></table><li>To create a link, put it between '<b>*</b>'s.<ul><li>If the page exists in the AniAniWeb (e.g. '*Existing Page's Name*'), a link to that page shows up on save.<li>In case the page does not already exist, the link shows up with a '<b>create</b>' button next to it; click on it to create the new page.<li>If the link is external (e.g. '*<a href="http://minnow.cc.gatech.edu/swiki">http://minnow.cc.gatech.edu/swiki</a>*'), a link to that external page shows up.<li>If the link is an image (URL ends in 'gif', 'jpeg', 'jpg', or 'png'), the image is inlined.<li>If the link is an email address (e.g. '*self@mail.me.com*'), a link to mail that person shows up.<li>You can add <b>anchors</b> to places in the text by adding a line starting with '<b>@</b>', such as '@My Section'. You can then create a link to that section using '<b>*</b>' and a '<b>@</b>'. So, '*My Valid Page@My Section*' will link to 'My Section' on the 'My Valid Page' page. If the section is inside the page you are linking from, you can omit the page name (e.g. '*@My Section*').<li>You can also <b>alias</b> all these links using '<b>&gt;</b>'. So, you can create a link like this: '*My Alias&gt;A Valid Page Name*'. The link will show up as 'My Alias', but link to 'My Valid Page Name'. For images, the alias text will become the alternate text for the image.</ul><li>Use any HTML you want. Here are some useful HTML tags:<ul><li>To make something <b>bold</b>, surround it by '&lt;b&gt;' and '&lt;/b&gt;'.<li>To make something <i>italics</i>, surround it by '&lt;i&gt;' and '&lt;/i&gt;'.<li>To make something <u>underlined</u>, surround it by '&lt;u&gt;' and '&lt;/u&gt;'.</ul><li>You may want to import HTML from another program. To do this, simply put the HTML between '<b>&lt;html&gt;</b>' and '<b>&lt;/html&gt;</b>' and the formatting rules will not apply.<li>You may want to share source code (C, Java, Smalltalk, etc.) on a AniAniWeb. To do this, simply put the source code between '<b>&lt;code&gt;</b>' and '<b>&lt;/code&gt;</b>' and the formatting rules will not apply.<li>You can also use <b>plug-in</b> tags, of the form <tt>&lt;?tag ...?&gt;</tt>, to include special features, such as calendars and graphs, in your page. To find out more about that, visit the <a href="#plugins">plug-ins</a> section.<li>There are three characters (&amp;, &lt;, &gt;) that have special meaning in HTML. Also, AniAniWeb adds two characters (*, @) to that list. In order to have these characters show up in plain text, you will have to alias them. This is the mapping for these characters:<br><table border=0 cellspacing=3 cellpadding=0><tr><td>&amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>maps to</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>&amp;amp;</tt></td></tr><tr><td>&lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>maps to</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>&amp;lt;</tt></td></tr><tr><td>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>maps to</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>&amp;gt;</tt></td></tr><tr><td>*&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>maps to</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>&amp;star;</tt></td></tr><tr><td>@&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>maps to</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>&amp;at;</tt></td></tr></table>These mapping can be used in page names too.</ul>
