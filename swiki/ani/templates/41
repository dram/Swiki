<p>An AniAniWeb (Ani for short) is a collaborative home page; while this home page clearly belongs to someone, there are areas that visitors can edit and contribute to. Aniani means "mirror" in Hawaiian Creole. If a regular static home page can be compared to a self portrait, an Ani is more akin to a reflection in a mirror. It is dynamic and there are often interesting things happening in the background which are independent of the individual looking in the mirror.</p><p>Consider yourself a guest in someone's virtual home. If you behave yourself badly, the owner might not be so keen to allow guests in the future.</p><p>AniAniWeb is implemented in <a href="http://www.squeak.org/">Squeak</a>, a Smalltalk with a liberal license. It was inspired by Ward Cunningham's WikiWikiWeb. AniAniWeb was created as a research project by Jochen "Je77" Rick of Mark Guzdial's <a href="http://coweb.cc.gatech.edu/csl">Collaborative Software Laboratory</a> at Georgia Institute of Technology.</p>
