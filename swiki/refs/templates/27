<p>Swiki has its own simple editing rules. To link to a page, surround the page's title by <tt>*</tt>s (i.e. <tt>*My Page*</tt>); if the page does not already exist, a <b>create</b> button appears next to the new title; click on it to create the new page. The extensive list below documents all the editing features; these features are meant to enhance your use, but you do not need them to get started.</p><ul><li>Carriage returns are preserved.<li>A line starting with <tt>!</tt>s becomes a header line. The more <tt>!</tt>s, the more important the header is. For example, <tt>!!subject</tt> will show up as <tt>&lt;h2&gt;subject&lt;/h2&gt;</tt> in HTML. Up to three <tt>!</tt>s can be used.<li>A line starting with <tt>_</tt> (underscore) becomes a horizontal line. This is often used to separate topics.<li>Using lines starting with <tt>#</tt>s and <tt>-</tt>s, creates a list.<ul><li>A block of lines, where each line starts with <tt>-</tt> is transformed into a bulleted list, where each line is an entry.<li>A block of lines, where each line starts with <tt>#</tt> is transformed into an ordered list, where each line is an entry.<li>Lists can be nested. Thus, a line starting with <tt>#-</tt> is an element of a bulleted list that is part of an ordered list.</ul><li>To create a table, start off the lines with <tt>|</tt> and separate the elements with <tt>|</tt>s. Each new line represents a new row of the table.<li>To create a preformatted section, begin each line with <tt>=</tt>. A preformatted section uses equally spaced text so that spacing is preserved.<li>To add an append (<b>add to the page</b>) area, begin a line with <tt>+</tt>. This will turn into a text area in the view mode, so users can add to the page without editing. This can be used to stop people from deleting a page's content; simply add the <tt>+</tt> line and lock the page; now, users are able to add, but not delete. Here are several options you can use with append areas (just add the character of each feature you want after the initial <tt>+</tt>):<br><table border=0 cellspacing=3 cellpadding=0><tr><td valign=top><tt>^</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Append area stays at the top and appends go down.</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><tt>_</tt></td><td>(underscore) Appends are separated by horizontal lines. This can be useful for being able to tell the difference between different appends.</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><tt>+</tt></td><td>Append areas are self replicating, so that an append also creates another append area. In this way, it is easy to respond to a specific append.</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><tt>@</tt></td><td>Appends are marked with a timestamp. This can make it easier to identify the dynamics of certain discussions.</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><tt>-</tt></td><td>(dash) Append areas do not show up on the page. Rather, there is just a button (<b>add to the page here</b>) that takes you to a separate page to add the comment. This is particularly useful in combination with self replicating appends (<tt>+</tt> above), so that the amount of append areas does not dominate the page's content.</td></tr></table><li>To create a link, put it between <tt>*</tt>s.<ul><li>If the page exists in the Swiki (e.g. <tt>*Existing Page's Name*</tt>), a link to that page shows up on save.<li>In case the page does not already exist, the link shows up with a <b>create</b> button next to it; click on it to create the new page.<li>If the link is external (e.g. <tt>*<a href="http://minnow.cc.gatech.edu/swiki">http://minnow.cc.gatech.edu/swiki</a>*</tt>), a link to that external page shows up.<li>If the link is an image (URL ends in '.gif', '.jpeg', '.jpg', or '.png'), the image is inlined.<li>If the link is an email address (e.g. <tt>*self@mail.me.com*</tt>), a link to mail that person shows up.<li>You can add <em>anchors</em> to places in the text by adding a line starting with <tt>@</tt>, such as <tt>@My Section</tt>. You can then create a link to that section using <tt>*</tt> and a <tt>@</tt>. So, <tt>*My Valid Page@My Section*</tt> will link to 'My Section' on the 'My Valid Page' page. If the section is inside the page you are linking from, you can omit the page name (e.g. <tt>*@My Section*</tt>).<li>You can also <em>alias</em> all these links using <tt>&gt;</tt>. So, you can create a link like this: <tt>*My Alias&gt;A Valid Page Name*</tt>. The link will show up as <tt>My Alias</tt>, but link to 'A Valid Page Name' page. For images, the alias text will become the alternate text for the image.</ul><li>Use any HTML you want. Here are some useful HTML tags:<ul><li>To make text <b>bold</b>, surround it by <tt>&lt;b&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;/b&gt;</tt>.<li>To make text <i>italicized</i>, surround it by <tt>&lt;i&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;/i&gt;</tt>.<li>To make text <u>underlined</u>, surround it by <tt>&lt;u&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;/u&gt;</tt>.</ul><li>You may want to import HTML from another program. To do this, simply put the HTML between <tt>&lt;html&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;/html&gt;</tt> and the swiki formatting rules will not apply.<li>You may want to share source code (HTML, C, Java, Smalltalk, etc.) on a Swiki. To do this, simply put the source code between <tt>&lt;code&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;/code&gt;</tt> and the swiki formatting rules will not apply.<li>You can also use <b>plug-in</b> tags, of the form <tt>&lt;?tag ...?&gt;</tt>, to include special features, such as calendars and graphs, in your Swiki page. To find out more about that, visit the <a href="#plugins">plug-ins</a> section.<li>There are three characters (&amp;, &lt;, &gt;) that have special meaning in HTML. Also, Swiki adds two characters (*, @) to that list. In order to have these characters show up in plain text, you will have to alias them. This is the mapping for these characters:<br><table border=0 cellspacing=3 cellpadding=0><tr><td>&amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>maps to</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>&amp;amp;</tt></td></tr><tr><td>&lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>maps to</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>&amp;lt;</tt></td></tr><tr><td>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>maps to</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>&amp;gt;</tt></td></tr><tr><td>*&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>maps to</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>&amp;star;</tt></td></tr><tr><td>@&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>maps to</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>&amp;at;</tt></td></tr></table>These mapping can be used in page names too.</ul>
