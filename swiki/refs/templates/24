<p>Welcome to this Swiki! A Swiki is a collaborative website; anyone can edit and create pages. While that may seem dangerous, it's also amazingly powerful. We all know quite a bit about writing and talking together; we tend not to mess up one another's space, we tend not to talk trash, and we tend to try to contribute.</p><p>Swiki is implemented in <a href="http://www.squeak.org/">Squeak</a>, a Smalltalk with a liberal license. It was inspired by Ward Cunningham's WikiWikiWeb (Squeak + Wiki = Swiki). Swiki was created by Mark Guzdial's <a href="http://coweb.cc.gatech.edu/csl">Collaborative Software Laboratory</a> at Georgia Institute of Technology.</p>
