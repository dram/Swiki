<p>If you are familiar with regular web browsing, it should be fairly easy to navigate through the Swiki. The only major difference are the special features:</p><table border=0 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3><tr><td valign=top><?viewHelpButton?></td><td valign=top><b><?viewHelpText?></b>: Pressing this button takes you back to simply viewing the page. References (the pages that link to this page) are shown there.</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><?editHelpButton?></td><td valign=top><b><?editHelpText?></b>: This enables the user to edit the current page. Pressing on this button brings up a form where the text and title of the page can be changed. The changes made take effect when the <b>save</b> button is pressed. Also, the user can enter a password that will lock the page from others editing the page. Be careful to remember that password; otherwise, only the administrator (or at least their password) will unlock that page. Plus, entering your e-mail address in the appropriate space will send you a message whenever the page is edited. Please, check below (<a href="#editing">Editing Rules</a>) to learn more about what kind of text is allowed.</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><?editlockHelpButton?></td><td valign=top><b><?editlockHelpText?></b>: There is a lock on this page. In order to edit it, you will need either the page's assigned password or the administrator's password. With the administrator password, you can edit and save a locked page and retain the assigned password.</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><?uploadHelpButton?></td><td valign=top><b><?uploadHelpText?></b>: With this feature, you can upload documents to the server. Attachments can be made to the page or the Swiki; page attachments can only be references from that page. To reference your attachment, insert <tt>*+myUploadedFileName+*</tt> into the page text, or chose the <em>add a reference</em> option when uploading and a reference will automatically be appended to the end of the page. Image (files ending in gif, jpg, jpeg, or png) references are inlined.</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><?historyHelpButton?></td><td valign=top><b><?historyHelpText?></b>: This shows the different versions of the page through time. Since pages are editable, it sometimes is useful to look at what was previously on the page or to correct a mistake.</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><?topHelpButton?></td><td valign=top><b><?topHelpText?></b>: Pressing this button takes you to the front page of this Swiki (the first page).</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><?recentHelpButton?></td><td valign=top><b><?recentHelpText?></b>: This feature lists the pages by the last time they were edited in reverse order. This is very useful for finding what's new on the site.</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><?searchHelpButton?></td><td valign=top><b><?searchHelpText?></b>: Using this feature, you can search for all pages that might contain certain word(s) or phrases.</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><?helpHelpButton?></td><td valign=top><b><?helpHelpText?></b>: Pressing this button takes you back to this page.</td></tr><tr><td valign=top>...</td><td valign=top><b>Guessing the URL</b>: Occasionally, it will happen that you know the name of the page you want to go to (even approximately), but you don't know the number and you don't want to try to find your way there through searches or browsing. For these times, you might want to guess using the URL. Simply type the words you remember from the page name in concatenated form after the swiki address; you can separate words by capitalizing the first letter of each word (a la Smalltalk). The Swiki will return the first match it finds to those words. For example, <tt>mySwiki/iWantCandy</tt> might bring up a page named 'The candy I want for Halloween'. Of course, you aren't guaranteed to make a match, or you might get the wrong match; in that case, it's back to the drawing board.</td></tr><tr><td valign=top>...</td><td valign=top><b>Rendering</b>: the administrator has the ability to render the swiki into a normal web site. This is sometimes helpful when reliability and portability are important. This feature is not accessible to the normal viewer, but it can be found <a href="<?toRender?>">here</a>. Note: rendering takes a while and uses up the resources, so it may be good to render when traffic is low.</td></tr></table>
