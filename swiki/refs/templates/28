Edit that page. In the text put <tt>*My New Page Name*</tt>. When you save the page, a <b>create</b> link shows up next to <tt>My New Page</tt>. Click on that and the new page is created. In this way, you haven't just created a page, you've also created a link to it so others can find it.</p><h3><a name="deleteFile">How can I delete a file I've uploaded?</a></h3><p>The simple answer is <em>you can't</em>. But, you can upload a file with the same name and that file will be referenced in its place. If it is really necessary to delete the uploaded file, contact your system administrator.</p><h3><a name="editConflict">What is an <em>Edit Conflict</em> and what should I do when I get that?</a></h3><p>An edit conflict is what happens when the server thinks someone else has saved the page before you. Thus, if you continued your save, you would delete their contributions. You are given both your version and the last saved one and asked to integrate the two. A real edit conflict happens rarely; however, some browsers (mainly MSIE) have problems with cacheing when you hit the browser's back button. If this is the case, just press the <b>save</b> button when you get the conflict. The best way to avoid this is not to hit the back button to re-edit a page.</p><h3><a name="restorePage">I accidentally messed up a page. How can I fix it?</a></h3><p>Every version of the page is saved. Go to the damaged page. Click on the history button. Find the last version of the page that was okay. Now, open up another window for editing the page and move the old content to there. Save.</p><h3><a name="imageProblems">Why won't my image file show up in my page?</a></h3><p>There could be several reasons for this. First, you need to save your image as either a GIF, JPEG, or PNG; other image formats (BMPs, PDFs, picts, etc.) are not handled by most browsers. Secondly, the file has to have the correct extension ('.gif', '.jpeg', '.jpg', or '.png') or the server will not recognize it as an image; it is not possible to simply change the file format by adding a different extension.</p><h3><a name="colorText">How do I color my text?</a></h3><p>You can use any HTML you want. A common way to add color is to use the FONT tag. For instance, you can make your text green by doing <tt>&lt;font color="green"&gt;<font color="green">green text</font>&lt;/font&gt;</tt>.</p> <h3><a name="centerThings">How do I center things?</a></h3><p>If you put what you want centered inbetween <tt>&lt;p align=center&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;/p&gt;</tt>, it will be centered.</p>
